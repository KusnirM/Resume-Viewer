# Resume-Viewer

Proposed Improvements:

* More unit tests and Instrumented tests - possibilities include to create matchers to verify whether the recycler view is showing X number of items while using the mockwebserver from Retrofit to handle a custom JSON response

* Implement click handling of chips in the details page to navigate to a screen where projects are filtered by the selected technology

* Implement a dynamic cache in the form of a collection data structure in addition to local persistence and remote retrieval in the repository

* Master detail flow to support larger devices

* Using Shared Element Transitions and other animation tools from the SDK to animate a few UI actions.
